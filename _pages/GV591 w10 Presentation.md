# Swiss 2020 CO2 Reduction Law and the 2021 referendum

## My part of the presentation

- Before getting into the referendum itself, let's first have a quick look at the Swiss electoral system to understand the importance of such referendums. 
- No single head of state
- No capital city

## Structure
- meaning political structure
- Also show map of cantons, distribution - cantons, municipalities,

- **People:**
- **Federal Assembly:** ^i1ezve
	- *Bicameral parliament*
	- *Both houses have identical powers*, every law must be passed through both
	- The Assembly possesses the legislative power, along with the separate [constitutional right of citizen's initiative](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Popular_initiative_in_Switzerland) 
	- **National Coucil** - 200 seats
		- Proportional per canton's size; voting 100% proportional List PR, no lower threshold [^1]
			- BUT there are many cantons, some have only 1 representative (basically FPTP), while some have PR system - but still small number of seats (bad for small parties)
		- Smallest - 1 seat, biggest - Zurich - 35 seats
		- Info: [Site 1](http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2305_B.htm), [Site 2](https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/3161/)
	- **Council of States** - 46 seats
		- among 26 states: 20 cantons have 2 representatives each, while 6 'half-cantons' have one each
		- 1-round (plurality) OR 2-round (majority) block voting (OR 2 exceptions)
		- Plurality Block Voting: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Plurality_block_voting
		- Info: [Site 1](http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2306_B.htm), [Site 2](https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/3448/)
	- **United Federal Assembly:** The two houses often come together in certain circumstances
	- Federal election wiki page: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2019_Swiss_federal_election
	  
- **Federal Council:** The executive branch/the government ^0p2xcq
	- **7 members** who serve as the *collective head of state and government of Switzerland*
		- Each Councillor heads one of the **7 federal executive departments**
			- Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Federal Department of Home Affairs; Federal Department of Justice and Police; Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports; Federal Department of Finance; Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research; Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications
		- **President of Swiss Condfederation:** *Not the head of state*, they are elected for *1 year* and do not represent the country themselves, but still just their department
			- Their vote is worth double if council's vote is tied
			- *BUT the council is the head of state*, visiting heads of state are received by all of them, and treaties are signed on behalf of the full council!
			- **Vice-President** is the member of the Federal Council who is expected to become President the following year
			- https://www.wikiwand.com/en/President_of_the_Swiss_Confederation
	- Elected every **4 years** after each federal election, incumbents are *almost always re-elected* (there are many conventions and informal agreements among political parties that control the election process)
	  
- **Federal Courts:** 38 federal justices are proposed by the Judicial Committee and elected by the United Federal Assembly (fun fact - upper age limit of 68; justices for 6 years; anyone can be federal justice, no legal training needed) - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland#Organisation
		- The Federal Supreme Court numbers 19 deputy justices, who are also elected by the Federal Assembly
- Is this the right way?

## Swiss Political System

- Mention Green Parties - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2019_Swiss_federal_election

### Swiss Referendums, Direct Democracy
Three instruments form the basis of direct democracy in Switzerland: the popular initiative, the optional referendum, and the mandatory referendum.
[Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2021_Swiss_referendums), [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/direkte-demokratie.html)

Swiss Referendums take three forms:
1. **Popular Initiatives**
	- Allow citizens to propose an amendment or addition to the constitution
	- Requires 100k signatures within 18 months
	- The authorities sometimes respond to an initiative with a direct counter-proposalÂ in the hope that a majority of the people and the cantons support that instead.
2. **Optional/Facultative Referendums**
	- Allow citizens to demand that approved bills are put to a nationwide vote
	- 50k valid signatures must be collected within 100 days of publication of legislation
3. **Mandatory Referendums**
	- All constitutional amendments approved by Parliament are subject to a mandatory referendum
	- Not mandatory to vote in, but mandatory to be held

### Political System - facts and figures
7 federal councillors, 26 cantonal governments, 2,172 communal councils and 5.5 million voters shape Switzerland's destiny: [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/politisches-system-der-schweiz---fakten-und-zahlen.html)

- Switzerland has no capital city, but Bern is the 'federal city'

### Political Parties
Switzerland's party-political landscape is balanced and relatively stable, with the green parties recently winning significant ground: [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/politische-parteien.html)

- Note

### Federal Council
The seven federal councillors govern the country as equals and in line with the principle of collegiality. They represent Switzerland's major political parties: [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/bundesrat.html)

### Federalism
Switzerland is made up of 26 cantons, which are themselves divided into more than 2,300 communes. The Confederation, the cantons and communes share political and legislative powers: [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/foederalismus.html)

- Note

### The Federal Assembly (Parliament)
Both the National Council and Council of States meet for three-week sessions four times a year. The two chambers sit together once a year to jointly elect the government and federal courts: [Official site](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/politik-geschichte/politisches-system/bundesversammlung.html)
